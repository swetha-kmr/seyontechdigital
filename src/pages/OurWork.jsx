    tagline: "When trust is the product, design is the proof.",
    excerpt:
      "MedCore expanded from 3 to 12 locations but their brand hadn't grown with them. Patients at each site experienced something different. Trust was inconsistent. Referrals were stalling — until we rebuilt everything from the ground up.",

      "MedCore came to us with a problem that looked simple on the surface: twelve locations, one brand. But when we began the audit, we found twelve different versions of the same logo, four distinct colour interpretations, two completely different appointment booking flows, and a patient experience that changed depending on which location you visited.",
      "Trust in healthcare is built through consistency. Every inconsistency is a micro-signal to a patient that says: we're not as organised as we need to be. We rebuilt the brand from its core — a logotype that communicates precision and warmth, a palette that moves away from sterile blues toward a confident teal-and-white system that actually photographs well in real clinical environments.",
      "The website architecture was patient-first: outcomes before services, booking in three steps instead of seven, FAQ content surfaced before the patient had to search for it. The mobile app was rebuilt around actual usage data — the features patients used most moved to the home screen; the ones they never touched were removed.",
      "The rollout across all twelve locations happened over six months. Staff training materials, environmental graphics, digital templates, and print collateral shipped on time, on budget, and in a format the client's internal team could maintain independently.",
